## Causal discovery

A causal graph contains nodes and edges which link nodes that are causally related.

### Assumptions

**The Causal Markov Condition** implies that once you know the direct causes of a variable, any other information about its non-descendants becomes irrelevant in predicting its value. 

**Causal Faithfulness** in causal inference states that the conditional independence relationships observed in a probability distribution accurately reflect the causal structure.

**Causal Sufficience** refers to the assumption that all relevant confounders (unobserved variables that influence both the cause and effect) have been measured and included in the analysis.
